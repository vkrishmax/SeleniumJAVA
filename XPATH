1. Child Axes
The child axis defines the children of the context node.
Child::*
Syntax:

//child::table 
The first location step selects the child element node of the root node, which represents the element root

element in the source document.
The child axis is the default axis, so it need not be explicitly expressed in the abbreviated.

It can be simply re-written as:
//table/tbody

//child::*/child::td[position()>1]
The position ( ) function, evaluates the context position of the context node within the context size. The position ( ) function is applied to the selected nodes in document order. It will select the second td in a table

It will select all the nodes that are Child nodes of table.
Please find the below screen shot for example.
Child Axes

2. Parent Axes
The parent axis contains only a maximum of one node. The parent node may be either the root node or an element node.
The root node has no parent; therefore, when the context node is the root node, the parent axis is empty. For all other element nodes the parent axis contains one node.

Syntax:

parent::node()

The below example will selects the parent node of the input tag of Id='email'.
Ex: //input[@id='email']/parent::*

the above can also be re-written as 
//input[@id='email']/..
Below is the image that shows you to identify using above example.
Parent Axes

3. Following Axes
â€œFollowing axis contains all nodes in the same document as the context node that are after the context node in document order.

Syntax:

The below syntax selects the immediate node following the specified node input[@id='email']
//input[@id='email']/following::*
Below is the image that shows you to identify using above example.
It will identify the immediate node which start after the current node.

Following Axes

The below syntax selects the immediate node of tag 'tr' with the specified node input[@id='email']

//input[@id='email']/following::tr
Below is the image that shows you to identify using above example.
It will identify the immediate node which start after the current node.

Following Axes

4. Following Sibling Axes

The following-sibling axis selects those nodes that are siblings of the context node (that
is, the context node and its sibling nodes share a parent node) and which occur later in
document order than the context node.

Syntax:
//select[@id='month']/following-sibling::*
//select[@id='month']/following-sibling::select/

Please check the below image for the above syntax executed

Following Sibling Axes

5. Preceding Axes
The preceding axis contains all nodes in the same document as the context node that are before the context node in document order.

Syntax:
//input[@id='pass']/preceding::tr

Below screen shot shows how the preceding axes selects nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, attribute nodes and namespace .

Preceding Axes

6. Preceding Sibling Axes

The preceding-sibling axis selects those nodes which are siblings of the context node (that is, the context node and its sibling nodes share a parent node) and which occur earlier in document order than the context node.

Syntax:

//select[@id='day']/preceding-sibling::select/
//select[@id='day']/preceding-sibling::*
